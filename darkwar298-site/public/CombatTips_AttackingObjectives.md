When you want to attack an objective like a Turret, communicate with your alliance members to launch several rallies at the same time against that target. You want them all to land as close together as possible so that the enemy does not have time to reinforce with fresh troops between attacks. Because of this, you can keep APCs parked next to objectives so that if they are attacked you can rapidly reinfore with additional troops without having to wait for marching time.
