There are several ways to attack a player who is stronger than you for a higher chance of success.

## Defeating a Base
When an enemy player teleports near you, don't attack the base immediately as it will be at full defensive strength. Wait for them to send out their APCs before striking at their base while their defenses are weaker, as the heroes and troops that remain won't be as strong and you will take less troop injuries during the attack.

## Attacking APCs
When fighting enemy APCs that are stronger than you, wait until after they attack a target like a base or another APC, then attack them to take advantage of their weakened state. You can also attack the same APC with multiple players at once to do a lot more damage and each take less troop injuries.

## Ambushing players who are rallying
When you see that enemy players are rallying, wait for the rally troops to leave their base and then strike their bases immediately while they are weakly defended, or attack their APCs when they return from the rally and are weakened.
