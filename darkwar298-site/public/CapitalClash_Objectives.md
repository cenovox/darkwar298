Capital Clash has two main types of objectives, turrets and the capital building.
## Capital Building
The capital building is the main objective for Capital Clash. Each alliance can defeat the defending toops to then occupy the capital building, similar to the armory fights we have done before. The progress for capture does not reset each time an alliance loses the capital, so if you capture 5% you will resume at 5% next time you enter. Each alliance should try to capture a turret or the capital building at least once to maximize event points for their players.
Teams that occupt the capital building should focus on garrisoning troops inside to make sure they can defend it against attackers.
Teams that are attacking the capital building should focus on launching multiple rallies at the same time in order to knock out all garrisoned troops before the building can be reinforced.

## Turrets
There are four turrets surrounding the capital building. Each time one is captured, the alliance that occupies it can garrison troops inside the turret to defend it. The turrets will do damage to enemy troops garrisoned inside the capital building, and the turrets will fire faster the longer they have been held. Preventing your enemies from capturing the turrets ensures that you will have an easier time holding the main capital building for a longer period of time.
