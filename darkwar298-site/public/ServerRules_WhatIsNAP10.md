NAP10 is a server agreement between the top 10 alliances, it stands for "Non-Aggression Pact". This is common in these styles of games and the rules are agreed to prevent players from attacking each other for no reason and to encourage players to form alliances and work together to keep the server strong. This is especially important with server-versus-server events as other servers are also competing to stay united and win events against ours.
